# 📶 **Offline Mode & Auto Sync**

FocusFlowV2 uses an **offline-first approach**:

### When Offline:

* Tasks are stored in RoomDB
* All actions (create, edit, delete) work normally

### When Online:

* Queued local changes sync automatically
* API updates MongoDB with latest changes
* RoomDB updates reflect cloud state

This ensures **zero data loss** and consistent behaviour.

---

# 🔔 **Notification System**

The app uses:

### ✔ Instant Notifications

Triggered immediately after creating a task.

### ✔ Scheduled Notifications

Generated using AlarmManager to remind users before deadlines.

Notifications remain active even if the app is closed.

---

# 🧪 **Unit Testing**

The project includes:

* ViewModel unit tests
* Validation tests
* API mock tests using Retrofit mocking
* Offline/online sync tests

This improves reliability and reduces regression risk.
