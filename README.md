## 🧠 **Architecture**

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

* **Model** → Defines data entities and handles network communication.
* **ViewModel** → Manages business logic and interacts between data and UI.
* **View** → Reactive UI layer built with Jetpack Compose.

Data syncs between **RoomDB (local storage)** and **MongoDB (cloud)** via RESTful API endpoints.

---

## 🚀 **Core Screens**

* 🔐 **Login / Register Screen** — Firebase + Google SSO Authentication.
* 🏠 **Home Dashboard** — Quick overview of tasks, stats, and focus insights.
* 📝 **Add Task Screen** — Create and edit tasks with time, location, and priority.
* 📋 **Task Status Screen** — View completed and outstanding tasks in one place.
* ⚙️ **Settings Screen** — Toggle dark/light mode, delete account, and manage preferences.
